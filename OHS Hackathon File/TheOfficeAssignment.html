		<p>The Office is an American mockumentary sitcom television series that depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. It aired on NBC from March 24, 2005, to May 16, 2013, lasting a total of nine seasons.[1] It is an adaptation of the 2001-2003 BBC series of the same name, being adapted for American television by Greg Daniels.

		The series debuted on NBC as a mid-season replacement and aired 201 episodes over the course of its run. The Office originally featured Steve Carell, Rainn Wilson, John Krasinski, Jenna Fischer, and B. J. Novak as the main cast; however, the series experienced numerous changes to its ensemble cast during its run. Notable stars outside the original main cast include Ed Helms, Mindy Kaling, Craig Robinson, James Spader, Ellie Kemper, and Catherine Tate.

		 The Office is known for its eccentric characters and hilarious interactions. These characters are often overexaggerated for comedic effect. However, consider whether these characters would be likeable in the real world. Pick one character and analyze their personality, actions, and behaviors. Are they psychopaths? Or are they just slightly exaggerated versions of real people you might meet in the office?
